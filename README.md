# isps

N/B: you can use this to link to a sub-page pending the method passed to the App.php file. e.g localhost/files/isps/public/home/contact.
Like when we built the sellers end on the medical market and added controllers to each of the pages,
we could have easily used one controller and added the different methods, and use call to each of the sub-pages
# public function contact(){
#    $this->views('contact/index', [

#    ]);
# }
